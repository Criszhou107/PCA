Reference
We will put our data in a pandas Data Frame, described here: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html

Data Frames are useful as they store information about the data (e.g. row, column meanings) along with the data itself. Sometimes you need to get the raw data into a numpy array to run algorithms in scikit-learn and we show how to do that in the tSNE example in the last section of the notebook below.
